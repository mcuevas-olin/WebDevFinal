- State: None.

#### 2. Database Interaction:
- Shared Information: Data received from frontend requests.
- State: Database state (e.g., list of animals).

#### 3. Server Setup:

# How the Color Change Component would work

If the color selector is in a parent component and you want it to change the color of multiple child components, you can achieve this by managing the selected color state in the parent component and passing it down to the child components as props. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Parent Component**:
   - Maintain the selected color state in the parent component.
   - Pass the selected color as a prop to each child component.
   - Provide a callback function in the parent component to handle color changes.

2. **Child Components**:
   - Receive the selected color as a prop.
   - Use the received color prop to apply styles or other attributes dynamically.

Here's an example implementation:

```jsx
// ParentComponent.js

import React, { useState } from 'react';
import ColorPicker from './ColorPicker';
import Component1 from './Component1';

import Component2 from './Component2';

const ParentComponent = () => {
    const [selectedColor, setSelectedColor] = useState('#000000'); // Default color

    const handleColorChange = (color) => {
        setSelectedColor(color); // Update selected color
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <ColorPicker defaultColor={selectedColor} onColorChange={handleColorChange} />
            <Component1 color={selectedColor} />
            <Component2 color={selectedColor} />
        </div>
    );
};

export default ParentComponent;
```

```jsx
// Component1.js

import React from 'react';

const Component1 = ({ color }) => {
    return (
        <div style={{ backgroundColor: color }}>
            <h2>Component 1</h2>
            <p>This component changes its background color based on the selected color.</p>
        </div>
    );
};

export default Component1;
```

```jsx
// Component2.js

import React from 'react';

const Component2 = ({ color }) => {
    return (
        <div style={{ color: color }}>
            <h2>Component 2</h2>
            <p>This component changes its text color based on the selected color.</p>
        </div>
    );
};

export default Component2;
```

In this example:

- The `ParentComponent` manages the `selectedColor` state and passes it down to `Component1` and `Component2` as props.
- Whenever the color changes, the `handleColorChange` function updates the `selectedColor` state in the parent component.
- The `color` prop received by `Component1` and `Component2` is used to dynamically apply styles, changing their appearance based on the selected color.

This way, a change in the color picker component in the parent component will automatically propagate down to all child components, updating their appearance accordingly.
